Hi Lingling，
玲玲你好：
1 Thanks for your last message. It was great to hear from you，and I can't wait to meet you．
谢谢你上次的电子邮件。收到你的电子邮件真是太好了，我迫不及待想见到你。
I hope you will know me from my photo when I arrive at the airport. I'm quite tall, with short fair hair,and I wear glasses. I'll wear jeans and a T-shirt for the journey, but I'll also carry my warm coat. I've got your photo—you look very pretty. I'm sure we'II find each other!
我希望我到达机场时你会凭着我的照片认出我。我个子很高，留着金色短发，戴着眼镜。这次旅行我将穿牛仔裤和T恤衫，但我还会拿着暖和的外套。我有你的照片——你看上去非常漂亮。我确信我们都能找到对方！
Thanks for telling me about your hobbies. You sound just like me! I spend a lot of time playing classical music with my friends at school, but I also like dance music-I love dancing! I enjoy sports as well, especially tennis. My brother is in the school tennis team-I'm very proud of him! He's good at everything, but I'm not. Sometimes I get bad marks at school,and I feel sad. I should work harder.
榭谢你告诉我你的业余爱好，听起来你正和我一样！我花许多时间和我的朋友们在学校弹奏古典音乐，但是我也喜欢舞曲——我爱跳舞！我也喜欢运动，尤其是网球。我哥哥加入了校网球队——我为他非常骄傲！他擅长每件事情，但我却不这样。有时候我在学校成绩不好，我感到很伤心。我应该更努力学习。
You asked me, "How do you feel about coming to China?" Well,I often feel a bit sad at first when I leave my mum and dad for a few days ,and I'm quite shy when I'm with strangers. I feel nervous when I speak Chinese,but I'll be fine in a few days. I'm always sorry when I don't know how to do things in the right way, so please help me when I'm with you in China! Oh,I'm afraid of flying too. But I can't tell you how excited I am about going to China !
弥问我：“对中国之行你有何感想？”嗯，每当我要离开爸爸妈妈几天时，起初我会经常感到有点儿难过，而且和陌生人在一起时我会很害羞。说汉语时我感到紧张，但过几天我就会好的。当我不知道如何正确处理事情时我总是很难过，所以在中国和你一起时请帮助我！噢，我也害怕坐飞机。但是我没法表达对去中国的兴奋之情！
See you next week!
下周见！
Love,
爱你的，
Sally
